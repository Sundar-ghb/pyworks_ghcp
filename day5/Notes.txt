Goals
- Wrap your ETL + AI logic in FastAPI endpoints.
- Accept file uploads (CSV) and parameters (threshold, engine, AI flag).
- Return processed results as a downloadable CSV or JSON.
- Keep the ETL and AI code modular so itâ€™s still testable.

Dependencies:
- pip install fastapi uvicorn
- pip install python-multipart
- pip install httpx


How to Run the Service:


- Start the server:
uvicorn etl_ai_service:app --reload


- Open the interactive docs:
http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs



ðŸ”¹ Example Usage
POST to /process with:
- file: your CSV
- threshold: e.g., 120000
- engine: pandas or polars
- ai: true or false
- return_format: csv or json

ðŸš€ Why This Is a Big Step
- Youâ€™ve gone from CLI tool â†’ HTTP API.
- This can now be:
- Called from a frontend dashboard.
- Integrated into a larger AI agent workflow.
- Deployed to cloud (Azure App Service, AWS Lambda, etc.).
- The ETL + AI logic is still modular and testable.
